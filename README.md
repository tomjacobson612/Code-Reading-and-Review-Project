# Code-Reading-and-Review-Project

The goal of this project is to take an old code base and refactor it to be more maintainable. Throughout the 10 week course the code base will undergo a series of refactors and reviews. If you are interested you may look through the commit history to get a clearer picture of how the code base has evolved over time.
